What is Promise :-
    - Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure or an
    asynchronous operations - either success (resolved) or a failure (rejected)
    - It's commonly used for things like:
                                        - Fetching data from an API
                                        - Reading files (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile)
                                        - Timers (setTimeout)
                                        - Database requests
                                        - Networks calls

Promise States : promise has 3 states -
                                        1. Pending -> The operation is still running
                                        2. Fullfilled(Resolved) -> The operation completed successfully
                                        3. Rejected -> The operation failed
                Once fullfilled or rejected is settled and cannot change state.


callback based async functions => fs.readFile
                                  fs.writeFile
                                  setTimeout

promises with .then() syntax => calling promisified with .then() & .catch()


async awaiy syntaxt => calling promisified with async wait , without .then(), .catch()
